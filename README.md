# CameraFilterTester

Test and make your own filter.

There are 16 filters currently which are contained in the GPUImage2 framwork : https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2

You can simply manipulate each filter with the sliders, and also can take the values of the filters if you want.

Enjoy it.
